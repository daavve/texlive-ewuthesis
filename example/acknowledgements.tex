\texttt{ewuthesis.cls was forked from uafthesis.  ewuthesis.cls fits Eastern Washington University Thesis guidelines and is maintained by David McInnis}


\texttt{uafthesis.cls} was originally written by Curt A. L. Szuberla, ``kludged from the [standard] latex2e \texttt{report.cls} and from \texttt{ucthesis.cls}''
in Fall 1996. It has since been updated by Matt Heavner in 1999, Dana Moudry in
2002, and Ryan Woodard in 2004. As the author of the more recent updates (2011),
I would just like to point out that 99\% of the work was done by, well, a
\emph{lot} of other people.

Thanks, guys.
